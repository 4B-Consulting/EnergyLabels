How can I define the loss:
- Targets labels are sets, so we want to predict unsorted lists.
- The elements of the sets are tuple (kind in {M, Y, ...}, value).

I can experiment with different kinds of loss afterwards:
1, 0, whether it is correct or not.
2, 1, 0, whether the kind is correct + whether the value is correct.
{2, 1, 0} x #entries, as before for every target label.

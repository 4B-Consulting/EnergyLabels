I am going to work for 3 weeks + 2/3 days. Follows the draft of the planning:

1. Theoretical studies of the problem:
    - What does the problem consist in?
    - How can it be tackled?
    - Are there similar projects available?
    - Are there similar dataset available?
2. Study on the dataset:
    - How many entries are there.
    - What is the average length of the samples.
    - How many labels are there.
    - What are the labels.
    - How many entries have labels.
    - How good are the labels (I see a lot of unknown, what does it mean).
3. Implementing the baseline:
    - Implement a model that is able to classify the dataset.
    - Firstly apply it to a similar dataset to validate the model.
    - Apply the baseline to given dataset, which gives 0.1 version of predicted labels.
4. Theoretical studies of the best approach:
    - Find state-of-the-art solutions.
    - Reading the literature.
    - Write down ideas to improve the state-of-the-art.
5. Write down the report of the work done so far.

This draft is meant to be refined as I tackle the task.

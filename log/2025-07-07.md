I am going to work for 3 weeks + 2/3 days. Follows the draft of the planning:

1. Theoretical studies of the problem:
    - What does the problem consist in?
    - How can it be tackled?
    - Are there similar projects available?
    - Are there similar dataset available?
2. Study on the dataset:
    - How many entries are there.
    - What is the average length of the samples.
    - How many labels are there.
    - What are the labels.
    - How many entries have labels.
    - How good are the labels (I see a lot of unknown, what does it mean).
3. Implementing the baseline:
    - Implement a model that is able to classify the dataset.
    - Firstly apply it to a similar dataset to validate the model.
    - Apply the baseline to given dataset, which gives 0.1 version of predicted labels.
4. Theoretical studies of the best approach:
    - Find state-of-the-art solutions.
    - Reading the literature.
    - Write down ideas to improve the state-of-the-art.
5. Write down the report of the work done so far.

This draft is meant to be refined as I tackle the task.

# Week 1

Task 1 and 2. About 5 days and 3 days, respectively, they are meant to be worked on together.
For example to find similar dataset, I need to understand the current dataset.

# Week 2

Task 2 and 3. 2 days and 5 days, respectively, they are meant to be worked on
together. In week 2 the analysis on the dataset is focused on the understanding
of the dataset to find relevant resources. In this case, the study of the
dataset is meant to identify the best model to tackle the task.

# Week 3

Once the problem is understood I can go back to the theoretical studies to
find other approach to improve performances. Basically, the baseline is to have
a starting point to improve the performances.

# Last 2/3 days

Review the work done so far, go through the log and write down:
- What is the problem.
- What is the dataset.
- What is the baseline.
- What are similar approaches.
- Ideas to improve the baseline.
